# One Snippet Pro

One Snippet Pro is an initiative to learn and practice the programming in one snippet , We start learning a language or a technology using a simple hello world and we lean forward step by step to become a pro , But in this demo i am going to code it in to one snippet and cover as much as concepts possible. This is a collection of useful code snippets for various programming languages and technologies. This repository aims to provide a centralized and organized repository of code snippets that can be easily referenced and used in your projects.
